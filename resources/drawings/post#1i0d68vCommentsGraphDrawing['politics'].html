These areas are identified as high-risk for a reason, they are inherently prone to wildfires due to their natural conditions. Fires in these zones aren\u2019t rare or unpredictable, they are an inevitability. When people choose to live there, they are knowingly putting themselves in harm\u2019s way and creating a financial burden for everyone else. Public infrastructure like roads, water systems, and utilities isn\u2019t likely to be covered by insurance, and taxpayers are left to pick up the tab. In 2022, the gap between total disaster costs and what insurance covered was $145 billion, much of which was for rebuilding public resources in high-risk areas. This cycle of destruction and rebuilding is irresponsible, unsustainable, and unfair to those who make safer, more logical choices about where to live.\n\nI\u0027m not saying people can\u2019t take risks or live wherever they choose, but they need to take responsibility for those decisions. If someone wants to live in a Very High Fire Hazard Zone, they should do so at their own risk, without expecting government subsidies or taxpayer-funded bailouts when the inevitable happens. The same goes for new developments. These zones shouldn\u2019t be expanded or further built upon, and local planning boards should prioritize safety by restricting development in these areas. There are plenty of safer places to live that don\u2019t require massive public expenditures every time disaster strikes.
