# `ml_core` Package

The `ml_core` package is designed to provide modular and reusable components for data preprocessing, model management, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, community detection, and utility functions. Each submodule contains classes following best practices and incorporating design patterns to ensure **extensibility**, **scalability**, and **ease of maintenance**.

## Design Pattern Summary

- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of utilities such as Logger and ConfigLoader.
- **Strategy**: Provides flexible strategies for interchangeable processes (e.g., data cleaning, evaluation).
- **Factory Method & Abstract Factory**: Enables modular data loading and model creation.
- **Facade**: Simplifies complex subsystems (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
- **Adapter**: Allows for different metric formats compatibility in the evaluation module.
- **Template Method**: Standardizes steps in processing methods (e.g., data transformation, modularity calculations).
- **Builder**: Facilitates the flexible creation of structured models and configurations.
- **Observer**: Notifies components about data or performance updates, ensuring a responsive architecture.
- **Decorator**: Adds functionalities dynamically to base classes without altering their structure.
- **Composite**: Represents hierarchical structures of models or communities uniformly.
- **Prototype**: Allows for creating modified instances without affecting the base model configuration.
