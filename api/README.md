## Design Patterns Used

### Template Pattern

- The **Template Design Pattern** is used to define a base repository interface for database.
- The concrete classes, **MongoDBRepository** and **PostgresRepository** implement the base methods defined in template.
- This allows flexibility in the underlying database logic.
- It is present in **DbTemplate** class

### Repository Pattern

- The **Repository Design Pattern** creates and abstraction layer for data access.
- This pattern encapsulates the logic required to access data.
- It isolates data access logic from business logic.
- It is used in **MongoDBRepository** and **PostgresRepository** classes.

### Connection Pool Pattern

- The **Connection Pool Design Pattern** manages the database connections efficiently.
- It allows the reuse of connections and provides scalability.
- It is useful in a concurrent environments.
- It is used in **PostgreSQLConnectionPool** and **MongoDBClient**
- **For PostgreSQL:** When a connection is needed, a connection can be obtained by using the `connection = pool.getconn()` method (to release them back, just use `pool.putconn(connection)`).
- **For MongoDB:** The pool of connections is initialized by `client = MongoClient()`. MongoClient will automatically manage the connections. To close the pool, use `client.close()`.

### Active Record Pattern

- The **Active Record Design Pattern** is an architectural pattern to accessing data in a database
- A database table is wrapped into a class
- This pattern is used by object-relational mapping (ORM) by default

## Singleton vs Connection Pool

### Singleton

- Advantages: 
  - Easy to implement and use
  - Reduces memory usage
- Disadvantages:
  - Doesn't efficiently manage multiple database connections

### Connection Pool
- Advantages:
  - Provides better scalability
  - Efficiently manages database connections
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires careful management of the pool size and connection limits to avoid exhaustion

Given the nature of this application, which includes a real-time dashboard, a **Connection Pool** might be a better choice due to the fact that:
- it handles simultaneous requests efficiently
- it can handle more users simultaneously
- it provides better control over the database resources

## AI Usage (ChatGPT)

### Advantages:
- It can be helpful in providing simple explanations.
- It offers sample code that is relatively easy to follow.
- It provides useful and well-structured information (e.g., the comparison between Singleton and Connection Pool)

### Disadvantages:
- Sometimes, it does not provide contextual answers and, instead, it gives out-of-context examples
- Regarding MVC, it can confuse the concepts of model and controller, which can lead to misunderstanding without prior knowledge
- It's easy to become overly reliant on its responses

### AI prompts

**Q:**: this is the requirement analysis of our project. can I implement Template method for database connections? and to have concrete classes for each database? *(Among with this message, the content of Requirements Analysis file was provided)* <br>
**A:** Yes, you can definitely implement the Template Method pattern for your database connections in this context. Here’s how you could approach it:
Template Method Pattern for Database Connections
Define a Base Template Class: Create an abstract base class that defines the essential methods for database operations (e.g., create, get, update, delete, close).
Concrete Classes: Implement concrete classes for each type of database you want to support. Each class will implement the methods defined in the base class according to the specifics of the respective database. <br>


**Q:** knowing the requirements analysis mentioned above, what would you choose for db connection: singleton or connection pool? <br>
**A:** Choosing between a Singleton pattern and a Connection Pool for managing database connections depends on the specific needs and characteristics of your application. Given your requirements, here’s a breakdown of each option:
Singleton Pattern
Definition: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where a single instance of a resource is needed throughout the application's lifecycle, such as configuration settings or logging.
Advantages:
Easy to implement and use.
Reduces memory usage since there’s only one instance.
Disadvantages:
Can become a bottleneck in high-concurrency scenarios where multiple threads try to access the single instance simultaneously.
Doesn't efficiently manage multiple database connections, especially in applications with high traffic.
Connection Pool
Definition: A connection pool maintains a set of database connections that can be reused, rather than opening a new connection for every database request.
Use Case: Ideal for applications with multiple simultaneous database requests, like web applications with high concurrency.
Advantages:
Efficiently manages database connections, reducing overhead from frequently opening and closing connections.
Improves performance by allowing multiple requests to use available connections from the pool.
Provides better scalability, especially under high load.
Disadvantages:
More complex to implement than a Singleton.
Requires careful management of the pool size and connection limits to avoid exhaustion.
Recommendation for Your Application
Given the requirements of your application, which includes a real-time dashboard that fetches live social media data and analyzes sentiment, a Connection Pool is the better choice for several reasons:
High Concurrency: Your application will likely handle multiple simultaneous requests for data fetching, preprocessing, and analysis. A connection pool can manage these concurrent connections effectively.
Performance: Reusing connections from a pool can significantly enhance performance compared to opening and closing connections for each database operation.
Scalability: As your application grows and potentially handles more data or users, a connection pool will allow you to scale better without the bottleneck of a single database connection.
Resource Management: It provides better control over database resources, ensuring that you’re not exceeding the database’s connection limits.
Conclusion
In summary, for a real-time dashboard application with high concurrency needs and frequent database interactions, implementing a Connection Pool will be more efficient and scalable than using a Singleton pattern for database connections.

**Q:** what design patterns are integrated in django ORM? <br>
**A:** Django ORM integrates elements of the Active Record design pattern. In the Active Record pattern, an object represents a row in a database table, and the object's methods are used to interact with the database. This is why Django models can directly save, update, delete, and query data using methods like .save(), .update(), .delete(), and .objects.filter().
This approach contrasts with the Repository pattern, where data access logic is fully separated from the objects themselves. Django ORM's Active Record implementation keeps data operations closer to the models, simplifying interactions for developers, especially in CRUD operations. However, it can limit flexibility, particularly in complex applications with multiple data sources or advanced business logic needs.
If you need more decoupling between business logic and data access in Django, you can create custom repositories or services to encapsulate data logic separately.
